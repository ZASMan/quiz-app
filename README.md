# Quiz App

It's been a while since I've done any personal projects, so I decided to create a project which builds on the skills I've learned professionally while of course, developing new ones.

The goal of this project is to create an application where users can create quizzes, and then users can initialize sessions to take quizzes.

My goal is for quizzes to have the option of displaying questions and answers as multiple choice, or accepting user input directly.

I've used [Suspenders by Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders) for my rails template to get me started quickly.

I hope for this to be a Javasript heavy application and utilize a 'modern' framework as thats probably my weakpoint as a developer at the moment.

Initial development began Monday, 6/19/2017.
